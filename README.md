## About

Don't like the Twitter rebrand to x.com? Neither did I, so I *forked* this Chrome extension that lets you revert x-branding back to the beloved bird, but added some rainbows!

The loading icon still needs to be replaced.

## Installation guide

1. Download the code of this project by clicking on the "Code" dropdown, and selecting "Download ZIP"
2. Save the ZIP file somewhere you can remember it, and extract it.
3. Open your Chromium-based browser and click on your extension icon, and click "Manage extensions"
4. Click on "Load unpacked", find the folder that you extracted from the ZIP file, and click "Select folder"
